Installation
------------

This plugin requires Hey0's server modification.

  1. Create a "plugins" folder inside your "bin" folder.

  2. Copy all the *.jar files into "plugins".

  3. Add "CraftAPI" to the "plugins" line of your server.properties file.
     If it's not already there, add the line. The line should look like this:
  
         plugins=CraftAPI
     
     If you have multiple plugins, separate plugin names with commas.
     Do NOT place any other .jar besides CraftAPI into server.properties.
